  description: So Ash used the wrong microphone for a bit (to hilarious effect) and Tom is in New England. We talk about geography of the East Coast (it's riveting), Ash clears his throat a lot, we discuss our new iPhones 6, then we talk about Primer for a bit. Like, eventually. We kind of talk about a lot of things. It's a talk-heavy show, even for a talk show.

  description: We're back this week after Ash's near-death cold. We banter for a while, discussing our various addictions, Dutch midrise elevators for-rent, and the weather (we're so sorry). But then we dive right in. We wrap up some talk on gender issues and GamerGate, whether or not an objective reality exists, time travel, the Standard Markdown kerfuffle, the Apple Watch, and negativity in the community.
